* Tried http:\\localhost in browser and got 503 exception
* have checked the physical path of the application and it is present as mentioned 
* checked the status of defaultAppPool and it is stopped
* tried to start the AppPool service but it got stopped on its own
* Went to sites -> default web site's basic setting to make a test connection
