Redis not started
================

* I have checked the status of the redis service and found the errors like start-limit-hit hence decided to start as a redis user to get more information

* su - redis -s \bin\bash

* /usr/bin/redis-server /etc/redis/redis.conf - check the config errors and to start the service

got the error:

cannot open file : /var/log/redis-server.log

* log file not present in that mentioned location and it is present under /var/log/redis/redis-server.log

* changed the log file path to /var/log/redis/redis-server.log  in the config file

* Started the service and it got up and running
* Systemctl start redis.service
